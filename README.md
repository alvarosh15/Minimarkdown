# Minimarkdown

My own implementation of a markdown parser made with javascript. It will be a small markdown parser (hence it's name) that will implement only a few features of markdown.


## Features
- [x]  Headings
- [x]  Bold
- [x]  Italic
- [x]  Unordered lists
- [x]  Links
- [ ]  Ordered lists
- [ ]  Better support for cli commands
- [ ]  Code blocks

## TODO
- Add support to inline markdown inside lists and headings
- Tests
- Refactor code
- Fix lists (right now they work but html generated doesn't include <ul> tag, just <li> tags)
- Documentation
